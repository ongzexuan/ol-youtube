So, in this section we explore some of the alternative aims that a firm

can adopt. Traditional theory assumes that we always maximize profits in

the short run. However, investing in large piece of equipment can make

a loss in the short run but make profits in the long run. Same for investing

in some other capital intensive product or entering another market.

Hence, long run profit maximizing should be a good alternative to

traditional short run profit maximization. However, this theory is not

very useful. Why? Because managers can just claim that they were attempting

to maximize long run profits. They can use that as an excuse and virtually

anything. The manager can always justify by say “Oh, you know, we did

make a loss but in the long run it will pay off.” Well, in the long run we

are all dead. This kind of excuse <inaudible> jokes in economics, for

example, like there was this man who sits in a railway carriage throwing

pieces of paper out of the window. Now, another man was curious and

asked him why did he keep doing this and the man says it keeps the tigers

away, it keeps the tigers away but the other man says there are no tigers

around here, it’s a city and the man throwing the paper replied “I know.

 It’s effective isn’t it.” So, we can do this in another perspective. The

boss of a company always does things. He will spend lots of money in

advertising. He would give a huge salary increase to keep workers happy

and then he will close the factory for two months and gives everyone a

break. He will move the business to a new location every now and then.

His deputy asked him “Why do you do such things?” The boss said “I want

to make my business profitable” but the deputy said “But it’s already

profitable.” So, the boss said “I know. It’s just goes to show how

effective my policies are.” So, in the long run theory of profit

maximization might be similar. It might be impossible to refute such that

it no longer becomes a useful theory in prediction and explaining

things. A philosopher might relate this to the Falsification Criteria set

up by Karl Popper.
