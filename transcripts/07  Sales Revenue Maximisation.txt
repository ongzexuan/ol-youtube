Now, what if instead of maximizing profits people want to maximize

revenue instead. That’s also possible according to economist <inaudible>

in the 1950s. Now, some of the bonuses of managers are tied to their

sales level, not profit level. Sales levels are also sometimes more

noticeable than profits because it’s like if I sell a lot of things I get

a huge sales level. And if it’s the manager, selling a lot of things is

his prestige.  His professional excellence might get a boost. He might

get a lot of <inaudible> for saying “I made a record amount of sales

this month” or perhaps you are a salesperson in an Apple store, you

get commission for selling Apple products. Do you care about the profits

of Apple? You don’t. You just want to maximize Apple’s sales so that

you earn the most amount of commissions. If a manager, if a CEO’s

commission is tied to his sales as well, he may just do this as that

will maximize profits. So, this is one of the things that could happen.

Sales revenue maximization.
