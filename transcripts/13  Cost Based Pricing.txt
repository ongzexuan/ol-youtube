And now an interesting question to ask is how do people actually set

prices in real life? Well, why don’t look around and ask? If you ask your,

let’s say, restaurant uncle, he would probably say “I take the cost

something on top so that I will earn some money” and this is what we call

markup pricing. Is he earning profits? Of course. The maximum? Well,

you may not be very sure. Here look at this diagram. First you draw the

AC curve, then the AR curve. Where is the profit maximized? That is

where the distance between the two is maximum. And where is the difference

between the price and cost the most? So, it’s here where it’s the

mark we have aligned. However, the uncle may simply take the cost and

add some additional amount on top. In this case he might just produce

here or here. It might be the maximum profit but that’s how things work

in life: cost plus markups.
